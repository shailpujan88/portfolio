Hi there! I'm Shail, and this is my portfolio website code built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a touch of JavaScript. Let's dive into the features:


## **Portfolio Features:**

* **Light/Dark Modes Supported 🌙☀️:**  Switch effortlessly between light and dark themes. Your preference is saved, even after you close the page!
* **Clean Code 👍:** Well-formatted and easy to follow. 
* **Real-World Showcase 💻:** Check out my actual projects!
* **Optimized for Speed 🚀:**  SEO metadata, prefetching, and deferring for a snappy experience.
* **Testimonials ✅:** Genuine reviews from friends and developers.
* **SEO Optimed** Just Replace The Content at <head>
* **And More!** See the details below.
  
## **Technologies Used:**

* HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
* Owl Carousel Library (for Testimonials)
* jQuery (to support Owl Carousel)
* AOS Library (for cool fade effects)
* Fonts: Augustina, Rubik, Dancing Script
* Bootstrap Icons

## **Why This Web Developer Portfolio Stands Out**

* **User Experience Focus:**  The dual theme and speed optimizations show I care about delivering a great experience.
* **Attention to Detail:** Thoughtful font selections and animations add a polished touch. 
* **Real Projects:**  This isn't just about tech skills, it's about what I can build!
